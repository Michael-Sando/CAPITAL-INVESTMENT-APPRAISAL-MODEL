## Company Background  
CTI is the parent company of a diversified group operating in **real estate, logistics, and concrete manufacturing**. One of its subsidiaries, **Trust Concrete**, specializes in the production of precast slabs for use in constructing concrete walls.  

As the demand for affordable housing and infrastructure has steadily grown in recent years, CTI management is considering investing in **new machinery** for Trust Concrete. This machinery is expected to increase production efficiency and help the company meet rising demand.  

---

## Case Study Objective  
The management of CTI must decide whether to proceed with the machinery investment by performing a **capital investment appraisal**. The decision is based on the **cash flows** generated from predicted demand, which were forecasted using previous years’ performance data.  

This project builds a **self-contained financial model** that outputs both:  
- An **Excel file** with projected cashflows, and  
- A **PDF report** summarizing investment appraisal results with visualizations.  

---

## Cash Flow Assumptions  
The investment cashflows are structured as follows:  
- **Year 0**: Initial machinery purchase (large cash outflow).  
- **Years 1–5**: Positive net inflows from operations, reflecting predicted demand and revenue growth.  
- The same cashflow data is used in both the Excel file and the PDF reports generated by the Python script.  

---

## Key Formulas Used  

### 1. Net Present Value (NPV)  
- Formula:  
  **NPV = Value of future cash inflows – Initial investment**  
- Put simply: *We calculate how much the future earnings are worth today by discounting them at a chosen interest rate (10% in this case).*  
- Decision rule:  
  - If **NPV > 0**, the investment adds value and should be accepted.  
  - If **NPV < 0**, the investment destroys value and should be rejected.  

---

### 2. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)  
- Formula:  
  **IRR is the discount rate at which NPV = 0**  
- Put simply: *It is the “true rate of return” the project generates. If this return is higher than CTI’s cost of capital, the project is attractive.*  

---

### 3. Payback Period  
- Formula:  
  **Payback = Time it takes for cumulative cash inflows to recover the initial investment**  
- Put simply: *How many years it takes before the project “pays for itself.”*  
- A shorter payback period means less investment risk.  

---

## Results (Based on Model Output)  
- **NPV**: Positive → The project creates value.  
- **IRR**: Higher than 10% → The project earns a strong return.  
- **Payback Period**: Within the project’s 5-year horizon.  

**Conclusion**: The investment in new machinery is financially viable.  

---

## Recommendations  
- **Proceed with the investment**: The project is profitable based on NPV and IRR.  
- **Run sensitivity tests**: Check how results change under lower demand or higher costs.  
- **Align operations**: Ensure logistics and real estate divisions can support the increased output of Trust Concrete.  
- **Financing**: Explore a balanced financing structure (mix of internal funds and debt) to minimize risk and optimize returns.

## Deliverables in This Project  
- `cashflows.xlsx` → Base data for projections.  
- `investment_appraisal.py` → Python script that calculates NPV, IRR, Payback, and generates Excel & PDF reports.  
- `report.pdf` → Manager-ready summary with charts and key findings.  
- `README.md` (this file) → Documentation & case study context.

With this model, CTI management can make an informed decision on whether to acquire the new machinery for Trust Concrete.
