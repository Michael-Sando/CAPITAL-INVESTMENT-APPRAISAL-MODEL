    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color:blue;\">Company Background</h3>  \n",
    "CTI is the parent company of a diversified group operating in real estate, logistics, and concrete manufacturing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One of its subsidiaries, Trust Concrete, specializes in the production of precast slabs for use in constructing concrete walls.  \n",
    "\n",
    "As the demand for affordable housing and infrastructure has steadily grown in recent years, CTI management is considering investing in new machinery for Trust Concrete. This machinery is expected to increase production efficiency and help the company meet rising demand.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color:blue;\">Case Study Objective </h3> \n",
    "The objective of this project is to determine whether the proposed machinery investment is financially viable by applying capital investment appraisal techniques.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The decision is based on projected cashflows derived from predicted demand, using performance trends from previous years.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The financial model created for this project generates:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- An Excel file containing projected cashflows  \n",
    "- A PDF report summarizing investment appraisal results with visualizations  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color:blue;\">Cash Flow Assumptions </h3>\n",
    "The investment cashflows are structured as follows:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Year 0: Initial machinery purchase (large cash outflow)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Years 1–5: Positive net inflows from operations, reflecting predicted demand and revenue growth  \n",
    "\n",
    "The same cashflow data is used in both the Excel file and the PDF report generated by the Python script.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color:blue;\">Key Formulas Used  </h3>\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color:blue;\">Net Present Value (NPV)</h3>\n",
    "Formula: NPV = Value of future cash inflows – Initial investment  \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms: The calculation discounts future earnings at a chosen interest rate (10% in this case) to determine their worth today.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Decision rule:  \n",
    "NPV > 0 → the investment adds value and should be accepted  \n",
    "NPV < 0 → the investment destroys value and should be rejected  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color:blue;\">Internal Rate of Return (IRR)</h3> \n",
    "Formula: IRR is the discount rate at which NPV = 0  \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms: It represents the “true rate of return” the project generates. If this return is higher than CTI’s cost of capital, the project is attractive.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color:blue;\">Payback Period</h3> \n",
    "Formula: Payback = Time it takes for cumulative cash inflows to recover the initial investment  \n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms: The number of years required for the project to pay back its cost.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A shorter payback period indicates lower investment risk.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color:blue;\">Results (Based on Model Output)</h3>  \n",
    "NPV: Positive → The project creates value  \n",
    "\n",
    "IRR: Higher than 10% → The project earns a strong return  \n",
    "\n",
    "Payback Period: Within the project’s 5-year horizon  \n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: The machinery investment is financially viable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3 style=\"color:blue;\">Recommendations</h3> \n",
    "Proceed with the investment: The project is profitable based on NPV and IRR  \n",
    "\n",
    "Conduct sensitivity tests: Assess how results change under lower demand or higher costs  \n",
    "\n",
    "Operational alignment: Ensure logistics and real estate divisions are positioned to support the increased output of Trust Concrete  \n",
    "\n",
    "Financing: Consider a balanced mix of internal funds and debt to minimize risk and optimize returns  \n",
