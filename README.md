## 🏢 Company Background  
CTI is a diversified group in real estate, logistics, and concrete manufacturing.  
One of its subsidiaries, *Trust Concrete*, produces precast slabs used in affordable housing and infrastructure.  

Management is considering investing in new machinery to increase efficiency and meet rising demand.  

---

## 🎯 Project Objective  
This project determines whether the proposed machinery investment is financially viable using capital investment appraisal techniques.  

The financial model generates:  
- cashflows.xlsx → projected cashflows  
- report.pdf → summary report with charts  
- Investment_Appraisal_Model.py → Python script for NPV, IRR, Payback  
- README.md → Documentation & case study context  

---

## 💰 Cash Flow Assumptions  
- *Year 0*: Initial machinery purchase (large outflow)  
- *Years 1–5*: Positive inflows from operations  

---

## 📐 Key Formulas  
- *NPV*: Net Present Value → Accept if > 0  
- *IRR*: Internal Rate of Return → Accept if > cost of capital (10%)  
- *Payback*: Years needed to recover investment  

---

## 📊 Results  
- *NPV*: Positive → Project creates value ✅  
- *IRR*: > 10% → Strong return ✅  
- *Payback*: Within 5 years ✅  

📌 *Conclusion*: The machinery investment is financially viable.
