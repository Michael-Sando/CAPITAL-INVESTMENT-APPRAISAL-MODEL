One of its subsidiaries, *Trust Concrete*, produces precast slabs used in affordable housing and infrastructure.  

Management is considering investing in new machinery to increase efficiency and meet rising demand.

## Project Objective  
This project determines whether the proposed machinery investment is financially viable using capital investment appraisal techniques.  

The financial model generates:  
- cashflows.xlsx â†’ projected cashflows  
- report.pdf â†’ summary report with charts  
- Investment_Appraisal_Model.py â†’ Python script for NPV, IRR, Payback  
- README.md â†’ Documentation & case study context  

---

## Cash Flow Assumptions  
- *Year 0*: Initial machinery purchase (large outflow)  
- *Years 1â€“5*: Positive inflows from operations  

---

## Key Formulas  
- *NPV*: Net Present Value â†’ Accept if > 0  
- *IRR*: Internal Rate of Return â†’ Accept if > cost of capital (10%)  
- *Payback*: Years needed to recover investment  

---

## Results  
- *NPV*: Positive â†’ Project creates value  
- *IRR*: > 10% â†’ Strong return 
- *Payback*: Within 5 years  

 *Conclusion*: The machinery investment is financially viable.
